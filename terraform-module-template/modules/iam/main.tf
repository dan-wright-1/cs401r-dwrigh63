# ── modules/iam ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Required resources (Task B1). Exactly one of each:
#
#   aws_iam_role                     MLEngineer, trusted by sagemaker.amazonaws.com
#   aws_iam_policy
#   aws_iam_role_policy_attachment
#
# Least privilege is graded in later labs, so start narrow: grant only the S3
# prefixes and SageMaker actions this role actually needs. A wildcard policy
# here will cost you points in Lab 2.

# TODO: implement the three resources above.
